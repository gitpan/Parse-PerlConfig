    - A recent change could cause backwards compatibility problems.  If the
      value to be pulled from a parsed file for a given symbol is a scalar,
      and that scalar is undefined, the symbol will be omitted from the
      configuration hash entirely.  This is due to a quirk of perl, see the
      BUGS section in Parse::PerlConfig's documentation.

      The reason for this change is to prevent symbols from populating the
      hash if they are simply undef scalars; this can either be caused by
      actually setting a scalar to undef, or, more likely, by a non-scalar
      value being set that is not then pulled out due to a Symbols or
      Thing_Order argument.

      For example, given a Thing_Order of '@$' and a configuration file
      containing only '%foo = ()' the configuration hash would have gotten a
      'foo' key, set to the undef value, due to how Perl is implemented (all
      symbols have a scalar thing, regardless of whether or not it's ever
      used).  The aforementioned change prevents this useless key from
      getting into the configuration hash.

    - Removed the $namespace and $filename lexicals that were once
      accessible from configuration files.  %parse_perl_config is now the
      only way to access that information.

    - Added File, Handler, Warn_default, Warn_eval, and
      Error_invalid_namespace arguments.

    - Renamed the Error_preparse argument to Warn_preparse.  This causes a
      slight backwards-compatibility issue if someone is currently
      specifying something other than 'noop' for the Error_preparse
      argument.

    - Added a Taint_Clean option, for untainting the opened filehandle
      before evaling the file's contents.
