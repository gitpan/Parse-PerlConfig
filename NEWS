    - Removed the $namespace and $filename lexicals that were once
      accessible from configuration files.  %parse_perl_config is now the
      only way to access that information.

    - Added File, Handler, Warn_default, Warn_eval, and
      Error_invalid_namespace arguments.

    - Renamed the Error_preparse argument to Warn_preparse.  This causes a
      slight backwards-compatibility issue if someone is currently
      specifying something other than 'noop' for the Error_preparse
      argument.

    - Added a Taint_Clean option, for untainting the opened filehandle
      before evaling the file's contents.
