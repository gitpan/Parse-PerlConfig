    PerlConfig.pm
        - fixed a bug where if there was no thing order for a given symbol
          (Thing_Order is empty, or the Symbol key is empty) undef was set
          for the symbol, rather than omitting the symbol entirely
        - replaced the paragraph in the BUGS section with a description of
          what could be viewed as a bug regarding the above change

    t/parse/things.t
        - renamed verify_symbols_are_undefined() to
          verify_symbols_are_nonexistent(), and altered it to use exists
          rather than defined
        - added Symbols argument to all verify_parsed() calls
        - fixed the tests call to account for the recent changes in
          verify_parsed() and its Symbols argument

    t/parse/testconfig.pm
        - added hash argument handling to verify_parsed()

    PerlConfig.pm
        - removed the undef of the entire namespace, which was causing
          some serious problems with caller() and closures (see
          http://shoebox.net/bugs/perl/delete-package.pl for an example
          script)

    README
        - added a note regarding the < 1.0 version number

    test suite
        - removed t/_*.t tests due to their internal nature; internals have
          changed a bit (especially _do_file()), and it's difficult to keep
          the test suite up to date; it's also not entirely correct to be
          testing internal features, it's much better to test the external,
          user-visible interface as much as possible

    t/parse/lex-test.conf
        - added for use by t/parse/taint.t

    t/parse/*.t
        - replaced Files and Handlers usage with File and Handler, where
          appropriate

    t/parse/lexicals.t
        - replaced usage of test.conf with lex-test.conf            
        - added verification of lexicals inserted and parsed out of
          lex-test.conf

    t/parse/taint.t
        - removed cleanup of configuration filename; it's unnecessary, due
          to the list argument call to system()

    t/parse/test.conf
        - removed $lexical_filename and $lexical_namespace
        - moved $success to the top

    t/parse/testconfig.pm
        - added lex-test.conf to %test_conf                  
        - removed Filename and Namespace keys from
          $test_conf{'test.conf'}{Lexicals}
        - removed lexical_filename and lexical_namespace keys from
          $test_conf{'test.conf'}{Symbols}
        - removed the tests for $namespace and $filename lexicals in
          verify_parsed_default_lexicals()
        - modified ok() to allow for the specification of a comment when not
          called as a method

    PerlConfig.pm
        - renamed Error_preparse argument to Warn_preparse
        - added Error_invalid_namespace, Warn_default, and Warn_eval
          arguments
        - reworked Error_ and Warn_ argument handling to store values in
          hashes
        - added handling for File and Handler arguments (they get merged
          into Files and Handlers, respectively)
        - reworked all $*_errsub variable usage to use the new %errsub hash
        - moved lexicals string construction into
          _construct_lexicals_string()
        - moved namespace construction into _construct_namespace()
        - added _valid_namespace(), and usage of it before the namespace is
          used
        - wrapped the call to _do_file() in a block so $SIG{__WARN__}
          catching can be localized
        - moved symbol parsing into _parse_symbols()
        - moved the undef of the entire namespace into a block so no strict
          'refs' can be localized
        - moved handler dispatching to _dispatch_handlers()
        - reworked _do_file() to take less of a role in handling errors and
          warnings; it simply takes an already opened filehandle, a
          namespace, a hash reference, and a lexicals string, and does an
          eval; untainting, error handling, and lexicals string construction
          are now handling in parse()
        - removed the $namespace and $filename lexicals from _do_file(), and thus
          from being used in the configuration file
        - added _encode_namespace() for use in _construct_namespace()
        - updated the documentation to reflect user-visible changes
        - intentionally made documentation regarding namespace construction
          vague to allow for future changes in how it's done


0.02    Mon Mar 20 22:57:26 AKST 2000

    - added Taint_Clean option, with documentation, and untainting of the
      filehandle used in _do_file()
    - added an Export section to the documentation
    - removed @EXPORT

    - updated README (the DESCRIPTION was out of sync)
