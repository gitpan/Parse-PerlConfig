DESCRIPTION

    The purpose of this module is to define parse().  This function creates
    a namespace, reads in Perl code, evals it, and then examines the
    namespace's symbol table for scalars, hashes, arrays, subroutines, IO
    handles, and globs.  It then does what you tell it to with these
    symbols.


A NOTE ON THE VERSION

    Currently, Parse::PerlConfig is at a version below 1.0.  This is mostly
    due to the fact that I have not received a lot of feedback regarding the
    module, so I can't determine if it's useful as it is or if there are
    major problems with it.  The version is not meant to indicate the code's
    stability; I have been using it in various production projects and have
    yet to trip over a bug.  The version is also not meant to indicate the
    interface's immaturity; although it is a fairly young module, I
    personally rely on the interface staying as it is, so most changes will
    be backwards compatible (I say most because 0.03 is ever-so-slightly not
    backwards compatible; see NEWS).

    So, Parse::PerlConfig is stable in both code (as far as I can tell) and
    interface.
