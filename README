DESCRIPTION

    The purpose of this module is to define parse().  This function creates
    a namespace, reads in Perl code, evals it, and then examines the
    namespace's symbol table for scalars, hashes, arrays, subroutines, IO
    handles, and globs.  It then does what you tell it to with these
    symbols.
